nuxeo-mqueues-importer
======================

## About

This module contains Producer/Consumer pattern and Computation integration into Nuxeo.

Producer/consumer pattern are exposed as Nuxeo automation operation and enable to do 
 mass import.
 
A WorkManager implementation based on Computation is also available.

## Warning

This module is under developpent and still experimental, interfaces and implementations may change until it is announced as a stable module.

## Producer/Consumer pattern with automation operations 

The MQueue here are used to perform mass import.

It decouples the Extraction/Transformation from the Load (using the [ETL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract-transform-load) terminology).

The extraction and transformation is done by a document message producer with custom logic, 
this module comes with a random document and blob generator.

The load into Nuxeo is done by a generic document message consumer.  

Automation operations are exposed to run producers and consumers.


### Choose the MQueue implementation

You can use Chronicle or Kafka MQueue implementation.

The default is Chronicle implementation, the `.cq4` files are stored under `${nuxeo.data.dir}/data/mqueue`.
  You can override this default using the `nuxeo.conf` option: `nuxeo.mqueue.chronicle.dir`.

To use Kafka implementation you need to contribute a configuration for instance:

      <?xml version="1.0"?>
      <component name="my.project.kafka.contrib">
      
        <extension target="org.nuxeo.ecm.mqueues.importer.kafka.service" point="kafkaConfig">
          
          <kafkaConfig name="default" zkServers="localhost:2181" topicPrefix="my-app-">
            <producerProperties>
              <property name="bootstrap.servers">localhost:9092</property>
            </producerProperties>
            <consumerProperties>
              <property name="bootstrap.servers">localhost:9092</property>
            </consumerProperties>
          </kafkaConfig>
      
        </extension>
      </component>

Then you can refer to this configuration by passing the configuration name in your
automation call using`"kafkaConfig": "default"` parameter.

### Two steps import: generate and import document with blobs

1. Run producers of document messages (file blob are part of the message)
  ```
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8080/nuxeo/site/automation/MQImporter.runRandomDocumentProducers' -u Administrator:Administrator -H 'content-type: application/json+nxrequest' \
  -d '{"params":{"nbDocuments": 100, "nbThreads": 5}}'

Params description:
    "nbDocuments": the number of documents to generate.
    "nbThreads": the number of threads for the producers and for the consumers
    "avgBlobSizeKB": the average blob size fo each file documents.
    "lang": the locale used for the generated document ("fr_FR" or "en_US")
    "mqName": the name of the MQueue
    "mqSize": the size of the MQueue which will fix the maximum number of consumer threads
    "kafkaConfig": the name of the Kafka configuration to use
```
2. Run consumers of document messages creating Nuxeo documents, the concurrency will match the previous nbThreads producers parameters
  ```
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8080/nuxeo/site/automation/MQImporter.runDocumentConsumers' -u Administrator:Administrator -H 'content-type: application/json+nxrequest' \
  -d '{"params":{"rootFolder": "/default-domain/workspaces"}}'

Params description:
    "rootFolder": the path of the Nuxeo container to import documents, this document must exists.
    "repositoryName": the repository name
    "batchSize": the consumer commit documents every batch size
    "batchThresholdS": the consumer commit documents if the transaction is longer that this threshold
    "retryMax": number of time a consumer retry to import in case of failure
    "retryDelayS": delay between retry
    "mqName": the name of the MQueue (use the same name as in previous runRandoDocumentProducers operation)
    "nbThreads": the number of threads on the consumer pool
    "kafkaConfig": the name of the Kafka configuration to use
```

### 4 steps import: generate and import blobs then generate and import documents

1. Run producers of blob messages
  ```
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8080/nuxeo/site/automation/MQImporter.runRandomBlobProducers' -u Administrator:Administrator -H 'content-type: application/json+nxrequest' \
  -d '{"params":{"nbBlobs": 100, "nbThreads": 5}}'

Params description:
    "nbBlobs": the number of blobs to generate
    "nbThreads": the number of threads for the producers and for the consumers
    "avgBlobSizeKB": the average blob size
    "lang": the locale used for the generated blob content ("fr_FR" or "en_US")
    "mqName": the name of the MQueue
    "mqSize": the size of the MQueue which will fix the maximum number of consumer threads
    "kafkaConfig": the name of the Kafka configuration to use
```
2. Run consumers of blob messages importing into the Nuxeo binary store.
  ```
mkdir /tmp/a
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8080/nuxeo/site/automation/MQImporter.runBlobConsumers' -u Administrator:Administrator -H 'content-type: application/json+nxrequest' \
  -d '{"params":{"blobProviderName": "default", "blobInfoPath": "/tmp/a"}}'

Params description:
    "blobProviderName": the name of the binary store blob provider
    "blobInfoPath": the path to store blob information csv files, this will be used to link documents with blobs later
    "retryMax": number of time a consumer retry to import the blob
    "retryDelayS": delay between retry
    "mqName": the same name as in the previous operation
    "nbThreads": the number of threads on the consumer pool
    "kafkaConfig": the name of the Kafka configuration to use
```
3. Run producers of document messages which refer to produced blobs created in step 2
  ```
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8080/nuxeo/site/automation/MQImporter.runRandomDocumentProducers' -u Administrator:Administrator -H 'content-type: application/json+nxrequest' \
  -d '{"params":{"nbDocuments": 200, "nbThreads": 5, "blobInfoPath": "/tmp/a"}}'
  
Params description:
      "nbDocuments": the number of documents to generate.
      "nbThreads": the number of threads for the producers and for the consumers
      "blobInfoPath": the blob information csv files path generated by runBlobConsumers
      "lang": the locale used for the generated document ("fr_FR" or "en_US")
      "mqName": the name of the MQueue
      "mqSize": the size of the MQueue which will fix the maximum number of consumer threads
      "kafkaConfig": the name of the Kafka configuration to use
```
4. Run consumers of document messages
  ```
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8080/nuxeo/site/automation/MQImporter.runDocumentConsumers' -u Administrator:Administrator -H 'content-type: application/json+nxrequest' \
  -d '{"params":{"rootFolder": "/default-domain/workspaces"}}'
  
Same params listed in the previous previous runDocumentConsumers call.
```


## WorkManagerComputation implementation

Instead of queueing work into memory or into Redis (which is also in memory), 
you can queue job in a MQueue.

To do so add the following contribution to override the default WorkManagerImpl:

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <component name="my.project.work.service" version="1.0">
    
      <require>org.nuxeo.ecm.core.work.service</require>
    
      <service>
        <provide interface="org.nuxeo.ecm.core.work.api.WorkManager" />
      </service>
    
      <implementation class="org.nuxeo.ecm.platform.importer.mqueues.workmanager.WorkManagerComputationChronicle" />
      <!-- implementation class="org.nuxeo.ecm.platform.importer.mqueues.workmanager.WorkManagerComputationKafka" /-->
    
      <extension-point name="queues">
        <object class="org.nuxeo.ecm.core.work.api.WorkQueueDescriptor" />
      </extension-point>
    
    </component>


When using the Kafka implementation you need to contribute a configuration (see above).

The Kafka default configuration used is named "default", you can choose another one using
using the `nuxeo.conf` option: `nuxeo.mqueue.work.kafka.config`.
